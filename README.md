# The Code & Supply Seal of Approval üêã

Code & Supply is dedicated to improving opportunities and working conditions for software professionals. In order to do so, we have created this repository to share the guidelines we believe create these conditions in a company. These guidelines cover the entire lifespan of a job from recruiting to the hiring process, how a company handles work life balance and even up to how it is handled when employees and a company separate.

## Companies
